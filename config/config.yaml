# configuration file for ibf drought pipeline

# Metadata for Drought Pipeline Configuration
# --------------------------------------------
# Author: [Your Name or Organization]
# Created: [Date]
# Last Updated: [Date]
# Purpose: This configuration file is used to define parameters for the IBF drought pipeline, including country-specific thresholds, ensemble member settings, and seasonal lead times for Early Warning Systems.
# Usage: The file is read by the IBF data pipeline to execute drought risk analyses and determine early action triggers.
# Notes:
# - Trigger model,Trigger levels and probabilities are defined per country and season.
# - Lead times are specified for each month, grouped by country and season.

# Key Components:
# - `countries`: Country-specific configurations for drought risk analysis, including trigger models, thresholds, and seasonal lead times.


droughts: 
  #no_ensemble_members: 51  # number of ensemble members to consider
  #minimum_for_drought_extent: 0.01  # drought extent for now is defined as binary 0/1 hence this is not unsed however it can be used to define the minimum threshold for drought extent
